        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>An owl is a type of bird from the order Strigiformes. Most owls are usually solitary, nocturnal, and have binocular vision. In the Hawaiian Islands, there are currently 2 different living species of owls: the barn owl and the Hawaiian owl, or the Pueo. Like other species of birds, owls usually make nests in order to lay eggs and take care of their children. </p>

            The Hawaiian short-eared owl, also known as the Pueo, is a subspecies of the short-eared owl. Although short-eared owls are common around the world, the Pueo is endemic to Hawai'i, which means that it can only be found within the Hawaiian islands. During mating season, the males impress the females through sky dancing and the females make the nests on the ground. Baby Pueos are dependent on the parents for about 2 months but sometimes leave the nest early just by walking out. Unlike many other owls, the Pueo is active during the day.

            Unlike the Pueo, the Barn Owl is neither native nor endemic to the islands, as it was introduced to the Hawaiian islands and is the most widespread species of owl and birds. Also unlike the Pueo, the Barn Owl is nocturnal like most other owls. They can be found at any time of the year. Barn Owls build their nests in higher up places such as trees or even man-made structures like abandoned barns, which is how they earned their name.

            There are 4 species of stilt-owls, Kaua'i stilt-owl, Maui stilt-owl, O'ahu stilt-owl, and Moloka'i stilt-owl, all of which are extinct. The Moloka'i stilt-owl was the biggest of the species. They were never seen alive but their remains can be seen at the Bishop Museum. The name Gallistrix translates to "owl on stilts," presumably named due to the species's unusually long legs. These owls tended to live on the ground due to the absence of other terrestrial animals, but they were still capable of flight. Due to their extinction, not much is known about their behavior.
