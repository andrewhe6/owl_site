        <h2>History and Origins</h2>
            <p>The Pueo is thought to have arrived sometime after the arrival of the Polynesians around 300 AD, however the exact date is unknown and some speculate they arrived earlier. The species was first named by Andrew Bloxam in 1825, who named it Strix sandwichensis. Today, the Pueo is now considered a subspecies of the more common short-eared owl, though some disagree and do not consider it a distinct species. They were widespread around the end of the 19th century, but has declined ever since, likely due to the introduction of the Barn Owl. </p>
            <p>The Barn Owl was introduced in 1958 by the Board of Agriculture in order to control the rodent population. The birds were imported from California and 15 were initially released at Kukuihaele on Hawai'i Island. Within the next few years, 71 more were released to the other islands. In the 1990s, some Barn Owls were given transmitters to allow for movement pattern tracking. They were about as effective at controlling rodents as mongoose since they mainly ate insects. Barn Owls instead competes with the Pueo for food.</p>
            <p>Not much is known about the Stilt-Owl due to its extinction. Human settlement and the introduction of pigs and rats are thought to be the primary factor for its extinction because their terrestrial nature made them more vulnerable to the invasive species.</p>
